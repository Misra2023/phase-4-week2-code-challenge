## Getting Started
Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x
Flask
Flask-RESTful

Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/superheroes-api.git
cd superheroes-api

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the project dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

-app.py: The main Flask application with API routes and resources.
- models.py: Defines database models using SQLAlchemy for superheroes, powers, and their associations.
- serializer.py: Contains serialization functions to convert database models into JSON format.
- seed.py: A script to populate the database with initial data for superheroes and powers.
- migrations/: Directory for database migrations created by Flask-Migrate.
- Database Models
# The project defines three database models:

- Hero: Represents a superhero with attributes like name, super_name, and a many-to-many relationship with Power.

- Power: Represents a superpower with attributes like name and description, and a many-to-many relationship with Hero.

- HeroPower: Represents the relationship between heroes and powers, including the strength of the power for a hero.

Seeding Data
You can use the seed.py script to populate the database with initial superhero and power data. The script generates random associations between heroes, powers, and strengths.

# To seed the database, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
python seed.py
Running the Application
To run the Flask application, execute the following command:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
The API will be accessible at http://localhost:5555/. You can use tools like curl, Postman, or any programming language to make HTTP requests to the defined endpoints.

That's it! You now have a fully functional Superheroes API with documentation on how to set it up and use its endpoints. Feel free to customize and expand this API to suit your needs.
